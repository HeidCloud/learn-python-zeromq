# Learn ZeroMQ by Example in Python #

This project attempts to be a way to learn ZeroMQ with some examples to explore its functionality. It is initally based in the [andrewvc](http://github.com/andrewvc)'s [learn-ruby-zeromq](https://github.com/andrewvc/learn-ruby-zeromq) project. I've copied its structure and its examples and I will attempt to have the same behaviour and output but with pyhton language instead of ruby.

Hope to expand the examples and be useful for other ZeroMQ learners.

## About ZeroMQ ##

According to its creators, [ZeroMQ] (http://www.zeromq.org) is a socket library that acts as a concurrency framework. [Ilia Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik) does a great job in his blog introducing its basic features. I am not able to do it better, so please check it [here](http://www.igvita.com/2010/09/03/zeromq-modern-fast-networking-stack/) if you still interested.
